/**
 * In the previous chapter, you saw that Javascript objects are dynamically collections of properties.
 * We can easily add new properties, change the value of properties, and even completely remove
 * existing properties. In many situations (for example, when validating property values, logging, or
 * displaying data in the UI), we need to be able to monitor exactly what's going on with our objects.
 *
 * So in this chapter, you'll learn techniques for controlling access to and monitoring all of the changes
 * that occur in your objects.
