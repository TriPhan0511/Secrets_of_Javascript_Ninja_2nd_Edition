    <!-- 
      We broaly differentiate between two different types of Javascript code: global code and function code.
      The following listing will help you understand the differences between these two types of code.
     -->

    <!-- Listing 2.2 Global and function Javascript code -->
    <script>
      function addMessage(element, message) {
        // Function code is the code that contained in a function
        let messageElement = document.createElement('li');
        messageElement.textContent = message;
        element.appendChild(messageElement);
      }

      // Global code is the code outside the functions.
      let first = document.getElementById('first');
      addMessage(first, 'Page loading');
    </script>

    <!-- 
      The main difference between these two types of code is their placement: the code contained in a function 
      is called FUNCTION code, whereas the code placed outside the functions is called GLOBAL code.

      These two code types also differ in their execution (you'll see some additional differences later on,
      especially in chapter 5). Global code is executed automatically by the Javascript engine in 
      a straightforward fashion, line by line, as it's encountered. For example, in listing 2.2, the pieces
      of global code that define the first variable use the built-in getElementById method to fetch the 
      element with ID first and call the addMessage function; they are executed one after another as they're
      encountered.

      On the other hand, function code, in order to be executed, has to be called by something else: 
      either by global code (for example, the addMessage function call in the global code cause the execution of
      the addMessage function code), by some other function, or by the browser.
