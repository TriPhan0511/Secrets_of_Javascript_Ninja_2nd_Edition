  <!-- 2.3.3 - Handling events -->

  <!-- 
    The main idea behind event handling is that when an event occurs, the browser calls the associated event handler.
    As we've already mentioned, due to the single-threaded execution model, only a single event handler can be
    executed at once. Any following events are processed only after the execution of the current event handler
    is fully complete!
