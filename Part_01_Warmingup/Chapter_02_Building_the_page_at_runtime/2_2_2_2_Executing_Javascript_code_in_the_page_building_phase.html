    <!-- 
      When the browser reaches the script node in page-building phase, it pauses the DOM construction based on
      HTML code and starts executing Javascript code instead.

      This means executing the global Javascript code contained in the script element (and functions called by 
      the global code are also executed).
     -->

    <!-- 
       In this examample, the Javascript code modifies the current DOM by creating a new element and inserting it
       into the DOM. But in general, Javascript code can modify the DOM in any degree: It can create new nodes 
       and modify or remove existing DOM nodes. But there are also something it can't do, such as select and 
       modify elements that haven't yet been created. For example, we can't select and modify the ul with 
       the ID second, because that element is found after the current script node and hasn't yet been reached and
       created. That's one of the reason people tend to put their script elements at the bottom of the page.
       That way, we don't have to worry about whether a particular HTM element has been reached.
      -->

    <!-- 
        Once the Javascript engine executes the last line of the Javascript code in the script element, 
        the browser exits the Javascript execution mode and continues building DOM nodes by proceesing the remaining
        HTML code. If, during that processing, the browser again encounters a script element, the DOM creation from
        HTML code is again paused, and the Javascript runtime starts executing the contained Javascript code.
        It's important to note that the global state of the Javascript application persists in the meantime.
        All user-defined global variables created during the execution of Javascript codein one script element
        are normally accessible to Javascript code in the other script elements. 
        This happens because the global window object, which stores all global Javascript variables, is alive and
        accessible during the entire lifecycle of the page.

        These two steps:

          1. Building the DOM from HTML
          2. Executing the Javascript code

        are repeated as long as there are HTML elements to process and Javascript to execute.
        
        Finally, when the browser runs out of HTML elements to process, the page-building phase is complete.
        The browser then moves on to the second part of the web application lifecycle: event handling.
