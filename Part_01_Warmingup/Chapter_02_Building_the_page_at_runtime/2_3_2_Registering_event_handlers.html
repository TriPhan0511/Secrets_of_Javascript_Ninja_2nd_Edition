    <!-- 2.3.2 - Registering event handlers -->

    <!-- 
      As we've already mentioned , event handlers are functions that we want executed whenever a particular event
      occurs. In order for this to happen, we have to notify the browser that we've interested in an event. This is
      called event-handler registration. In client-side web applications, there are two ways to register events:

        * By assigning functions to special properties.
        * By using the built-in addEventListener method.

      For example, writing the following code assigns a function to the special onload property of the window object:

          window.onload = function(){};
      
      An event handler for the load event (when the DOM is ready and fully built) is registered. 
      Similarly, if we want to register a handler for the click event on the document's body, we can write
      something along these lines:

          document.body.onclick = function(){};

      Assigning functions to special properties is an easy and straightforward way of registering event handlers,
      and you've probably run into it already. But we don't recommend that you register event handler this way, 
      because doing so comes with a drawback: It's only possible to register one function handler for a particular
      event. This means it's easy to overwrite previous handler-functions, which can be a little frustrating.

      Luckily, there's an alternative: The addEventListener method enable us to register 
      as many event-handler functions as we need.

      Example:
     -->

    <!-- Listing 2.3 - Registering event handlers -->
    <h4>Click here</h4>
    <ul id="second"></ul>

    <script>
      // Defines a functions that adds a message to an element
      function addMessage(element, message) {
        const messageElement = document.createElement('li');
        messageElement.textContent = message;
        element.appendChild(messageElement);
      }

      // Registers a handler for the mousemove event
      document.body.addEventListener('mousemove', function () {
        addMessage(document.getElementById('second'), 'Event: mousemove');
      });

      // Registers a handler for the click event
      document.body.addEventListener('click', function () {
        addMessage(document.getElementById('second'), 'Event: click');
      });
    </script>

    <!-- 
      This example uses the built-in addEventListener method on an HTM element to specify the type of 
      event (mousemove or click ) and the event-handler function. This means whenever the mouse is moved over 
      the page , the browser call a function that adds a message, "Event: mousemove", to the list element with
      the ID second (a similar message, "Event: click", is added to the same element whenever the body is clicked).
