      Client-side web applications are GUI applications, which mean they react to fifferent kinds of events:
      mouse moves, clicks, keyboard presses, and so on. 
      For this reason, the Javascript executed during the page-building phase, in addition to influencing the 
      global application state and modifying DOM, can also register event listeners (or handlers): functions
      that executed by the browser when an event occurs. With these event handlers, we provide interactivity to
      our applications. But before taking a closer look at registering event handlers, let's go through the
      general ideas behind event handling.

    <!-- 
      2.3.1 - Event-handling overview

      The browser execution environment is, at its core, based on the idea that only a single piece of code can
      be executed at once: the so-called single-threaded execution model.
      Think of a line at the bank. Everyone gets into a single line and has to wait their turn to be "processed"
      by the tellers. But with Javascript, only one teller window is open! Customers (events) are processed only 
      one at a time, as their turn come. All it takes is one person who thinks it's appropriate to do their 
      financial planning for the entire fiscal year while they're at the teller's window (we've all run into them!)
      to gum up the works.

      Whenever an event occurs, the browser should execute the associated event-handler function. But there's no
      guarantee that we have extremely patient users who will always wait an appropriate amount of time before 
      triggering another event. For this reason, the browser needs a way to keep track of the events that have
      occurred but have yet to be processed. To do this, the browser uses an event queue.
    -->

    <!-- 
      All generated events (it doesn't matter if they're user-generated, like mouse moves or key presses, 
      or server-generated, such as Ajax events) are placed in the same event queue, in the order in which 
      they're detected by the browser.
      The event-handling process can then be described with a simple flowchart:

        * The browser checks the head of the event queue.
        * If there ser no events, the browser kepps checking.
        * If there's an event at the head of the event queue, the browser takes it and executes the associated
          handler (if one exists). During this execution, the rest of the events patiently wait in the 
          event queue for their turn to be processed.

      Because only one event is handled at a time, we have to be extra careful about the amount of time needed
      for handling events; writing event handlers that take a lot of time to excute leads to unresponsive
      application! (Don't worry if this sounds a bit vague; we'll come back to the event loop in chapter 13
      and see exactly how it impacts the perceived performance of web applications).

      It's important to note that the browser mechanism that puts events onto the queue is external to the
      page-building and event-handling phases. The processing that's neccessary to determine when events
      have occured and that pushes them onto the event queue doesn't participate in the thread that's
      handling the events.
     -->

    <!-- 
      EVENTS ARE ASYNCHRONOUS

      Events, when they happen, can occur at unpredictable times and in an unpredictable order (it's tricky to
      force users to press keys or click in some particular order). We say that the handling of events, and 
      therefore the invocation of their handling functions, is asynchronous.

      The following types of events can occur, among others:

        * Browser events, such as when a page is finished loading or when it's to be unloaded.
        * Network events, such as responses coming from the server (Ajax events, serside events)
        * User events, such as mouse clicks, mouse moves, and key presses.
        * Timer events, such as when a timeout expires or an interval fires.

      The vast majority of code executes as a result of such events!

      Before events can be handled, our code has to notify the browser that we're interested in handling 
      particular events. Let's look how to register event handlers.
